# TrendPredict

**TrendPredict** is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting trends in various domains, such as stock markets, social media, and e-commerce. The project leverages historical data and advanced algorithms to forecast future patterns, helping users make data-driven decisions.

## Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Uses state-of-the-art machine learning models for high-accuracy trend forecasting.
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Supports a variety of data inputs including financial, social media, and market data.
- **Real-time Updates**: Continuously updates predictions based on new data.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and model building.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing traditional machine learning algorithms.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shailsharma2604/TrendPredict.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Prepare the dataset:
    - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory or link it through an API (e.g., stock market data).
    - Preprocess the data using the scripts provided.

4. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

5. Run predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Input**: Upload historical data to the project directory or configure an API to stream real-time data.
2. **Model Training**: Use the training script to train models based on the historical data.
3. **Predictions**: After training, use the prediction script to generate trend forecasts.
4. **Visualization**: View predictions through the provided visualization tools.
